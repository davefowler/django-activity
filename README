Django-Activity
==================

A simple app that makes it easy to store user activities (events) on your site such as page visits, model edits, etc.

This is similar to Google Analytics or Mixpanel, except its stored in your own database and no requests to outside services are needed.


WHY
========

Because its important to start collecting data, even if you don't have the capabilities to start plotting and understanding it yet.

Because it has to be simple.

Because storing these metrics in a local database is much faster than pinging an external service.

Because storing the data localy gives ultimate control and privacy.

Because danger never takes a vacation!


USAGE
=======

Storing a new activity record is incredibly easy.  Simply create and save a new activity object
giving it the request object, a subject and two optional values.

from activity import Activity
Activity(request, subject, value1, value2)


Examples: 
==========

# Record a page view and its referer
Activity(request, 'pageview', request.get_full_path(), request.META.get("HTTPREFERER", "")).save()


# Record that the user edited their profile
Activity(request, 'profile-edit')

# Record a phase in a singup funnel
Activity(request, 'signup-funnel', 3, 'submitteddetails')  

# Record that a song was played
Activity(request, 'song-played', 'Hey Jude')
